# My Very First Web Page 

## Welcome!

### This is the beginning of my journey into Software Development. 
### After skimming over the basics of HTML and CSS I am now working on User Centric Front End Development.
### Starting with Command Line Interface moving to Git and GitHub. 

## The Project 
### The project that I have been working on is an informative website that provides links to Wikipedia for all the programming languages.
### Working with CSS I changed the font, font colour, and the alignment along with the background colours and the hover colour. 
### After completion of the website I got to grips with Git and Github, and have deployed my website and git into github. 

## My Conclusion 
### This has been a very informative lesson, I have made a few mistakes while following the tutor but have been able to get back on track.
### I look forward to fully understanding these methods with practice and many more mistakes.
